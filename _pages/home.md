We are the Secure and Advanced Computer Architecture (SACA) Research Group, a research lab located at North Carolina State University (moving from University of Central Florida since Fall 2020). NC State is constantly ranked among the top universities in the nation for computer architecture and high-performance computing. For instance, the <b> CSRankings.org </b> provides a metric-based ranking based on publications in top venues, where NC State stands as  <b> #1 </b> in USA for the area of high-performance computing and  <b>#12</b> in computer architecture for the last 5 years as of December 2020.  

Our research group works on cutting-edge problems in computer architecture and high-performance computing systems, with a focus on secure architectures and memory systems. [More information about our research]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/research/). SACA members have been actively publishing in the most prestigious and top-tier computer architecture conferences.

Currently SACA has six Ph.D. students and three undergraduate interns from renowned national programs and academic clubs. [Our group members]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/members/). We are actively looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students with solid background in computer architecture and interest in doing cutting-edge research. Promising Ph.D. applicants will be fully-funded (salary + tuition). Promising candidate typically have 100+ TOEFL scores, 310+ GRE scores, a GPA of 3.8+ (stand among top 5% in their graduating class), and have a research experience with at least one publication. We are also recruiting postdoctoral scholars to work on bleeding-edge research topics, and help us define the future of secure hardware architectures.
