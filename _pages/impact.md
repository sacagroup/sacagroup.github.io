# Impact on Industry

In this page, we highlight the main inventions of SACA members that have had direct impact on industry. Beyond the several tools and ideas we contributed to various defense agencies, we hightlight the public ones that have impacted public features in industrial products:

#### Cryptographic Shredding/Erasure for Secure Non-Volatile Memory
Back in 2015, we have invented and pioneered the first work that addresses secure data erasure in emerging non-volatile memory. The paper was published in ASPLOS'16 [Silent Shredder](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2980024.2872377), where we discussed how using different encryption keys, manipulating nonces, etc., can be used to effectively and securely erase data. These insights and very similar techniques are used today in Intel's Optane Persistent Memory as the [Secure Erase](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/how-to-securely-erase-data-on-intel-optane-persistent-memory.html) feature.


#### Crash Consistency for Secure NVMs
The crash consistency issue caused by losing the contents of security metadata cache was first discovered and discussed in our ASPLOS'16 [Silent Shredder](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2980024.2872377) paper in Section 7.1. This issue has been later picked up by academia and led to hundreds of papers in this domain that are addressing this problem.


#### Next?
We are confident that several of our contributions and ideas will be deployed in industry 5-10 years down the road, once future technologies become widely used. Today, we think of the issues and features the industry can leverage 5-10 years later.
