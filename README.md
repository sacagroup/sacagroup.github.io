# SACA Group Website

This is the website of our academic research group at North Carolina State University.

It is a fork of the website used by the Allan Lab, thanks to them for open sourcing their project.

This website is powered by Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootwatch. We tried to make it simple yet adaptable, so that it is easy for you to re-use it for your purpose. Plese feel free to copy and modify for your own purposes.  You don't have to link to us or mention us (but of course we appreciate it).

Go to *aboutwebsite.md*  to learn how to copy and modidy this page for your purpose.
