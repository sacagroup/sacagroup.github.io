  info: Prof. Amro Awad is currently an assistant professor and leads the Secure and Advanced Computer Architecture (SACA) research group at NC State. Before joining NC State in Fall 2020, he was an assistant professor at UCF (2017-2020). Before that, he was a Senior Member of Technical Staff (SMTS) at the Scalable Computer Architecture group (org. 1422) in Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque NM. Amro received his PhD degree from NC State University in 2016. During his Ph.D., he had several stints at LANL, HP Labs and AMD Research. His research papers have been published in top-venues in computer architecture, such as ISCA, MICRO, HPCA, ASPLOS, PACT and ICS. His work was a best paper award nominee in ICS’21, won the outstanding paper award in HPCC’21, and best paper candidate for IEEE VR'22. He holds six granted patents (more than seven pending). His research interests include secure memory systems, emerging memory architectures, architectural modeling and simulation, and hardware/software co-design. His research group has been funded by NSF, NSWCDD, ONR, DARPA, Sandia National Laboratories, US Army CCDC, and AFRL. He pioneered the area of persistent security, where the security, high-availability and crash consistency need to be guaranteed in future memory systems. Finally, he served as the PI of the DARPA's MemSec project resulting dozens of novel ideas and hardware IPs in area of secure memory.
